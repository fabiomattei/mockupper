todo:

* Add a posttype for options
* Add a posttype and a core API for cron stuff
* Modify the core in order to add user permissions system
* Modify the core in order to add offices permissions system
* Think about how to create a setting thing related to a posttype in order to make it more indipendent from other datastore
  for example we have a dependency between todos and users with an externa key to the package
  this can be done whit a settings.php file contained in the posttype folder that contains 
  a set of constants used in queries and UI strings.
* Add nonce logic (functions library) for security in links and forms
* Add the logic to abstract the interface from html so it will be possible to change the skeen of the application
  and there will be no dependency between application and interface

in progress:

* create a way for logging in users


done:

* create a way for handling custom post types
* create a way for handling aggregators (contains list of posts)
