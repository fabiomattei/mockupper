todo:

* Add a posttype for options
* Add a posttype and a core API for cron stuff
* Modify the core in order to add user permissions system
* Modify the core in order to add offices permissions system
* Think about how to create a setting thing related to a posttype in order to make it more indipendent from other posttypes
  for example we have a dependency between todos and users with an externa key to the package
* Add nonce logic (functions library) for security in links and forms

in progress:

* create a way for logging in users


done:

* create a way for handling custom post types
* create a way for handling aggregators (contains list of posts)
